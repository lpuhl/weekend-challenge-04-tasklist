# weekend-challenge-04-tasklist

__To Do for the To-Do List:__

• Clean up the code, I'm sure. I believe there's some extra stuff in there that's unnecessary. 

• Make the checkboxes display correctly when the page loads.

• Order the list of tasks.

Note: I wanted to leave the tasks editable, even after they were completed, and I wanted the option to "un-complete" them by checking the box again. Maybe over the next couple days I'll do the Hard Mode and add an "are you sure" pop-up before the task becomes "completed." Then I wouldn't need to option to "un-complete." 

Also, I left the SerializeArray business in there to make it easier to add more fields in the future. Though I suppose I could use practice doing it the simpler way, too...
